# Global CO2 Emissions
## Summary
This project takes a deep dive into the patterns of Global CO2 Emissions while zooming on country performances over the last few decades, and looking into correlations with population size, industries and global events.
## Languages and Libraries Used
The work on this project was executed on Looker Studio, retrieving datasets from BigQuery and Google Sheets. The data cleaning was done with Pandas.
## Key Learnings
In this project, we developed a comprehensive Looker Studio dashboard to analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and climate change. This project refined my skills in data visualization, storytelling, and insights communication. I practiced cleaning and structuring large datasets, designing interactive charts, and making data accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences. Beyond technical aspects, this project emphasized the importance of translating complex data into actionable insights, a crucial skill for any data professional.
## Challenges Overcame
Finding accurate datasets that are available publicly was quite the challenge, and since the datasets were from multiple sources, we had to adapt certain columns to match and merge the data.
## Additional Reflections
We would like to eventually look into datasets that will help us showcase the global commitments to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and look at each nation's performance compared to its goals.
